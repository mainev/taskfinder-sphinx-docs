Executable
==========
You can also run other executable programs (.exe) within Task Finder. On the **Executable** action dialog,
you will be presented with the following:

* **Program** - executable location
* **Delay** - if you want to add delay on executable (0 seconds as default)
* **Description** - a description to describe what the executable is doing
* **Command Line Arguments** - arguments or parameters to pass on the executable

Once all required fields have been completed, you will need to click the **Add Program** button to add your 
executable to the Program sequence. You can put multiple executables in one action. Each will be executed as ordered on the program sequence.
