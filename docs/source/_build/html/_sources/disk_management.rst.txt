Disk Management
===============


Encrypted Disk
--------------
The current setup of Task Finder uses a `veracrypt <https://www.veracrypt.fr/code/VeraCrypt/>`_ 
disk and mounts it as the system's **Default Workflow Directory**.


Shares
------
The **Shares** page provides you a quick setup of the share permission of a folder
from the Task Finder's hosted server. 

.. note::

    If the share you created already exists on the server, you will have
    to remove the share manually from the server to override it.
