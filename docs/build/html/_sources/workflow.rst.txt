Workflow
=================
A workflow is a step-by-step definition of a task or procedure. It can contain
multiple actions depending on how you want your task to be automated.

General Details
---------------
The **General** tab contains all basic information needed to create a workflow.

When creating your first workflow, the **Use Default Workflow Folder** will be checked as default.
A workflow folder contains all the logs, archives, and error details of your task.

All the folders will be generated automatically. The default workflow folder is defined in the :doc:`disk_management`


Email Notifications
-------------------
Task Finder will send an auto-generated email everytime your task has been completed. This can be disabled on the
**Email Notification** tab. 

**Send only when new data available** - if active, will send email notification only when new files or data are detected.


Email Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~
On **Email Groups**, you can group email recipients who will receive the task notification. 
We have 3 types of alerts: **Basic**, **All**, **Error**

* **Basic** - will receive basic alerts (may contain error only caused by incorrect data or configuration).
* **All** - will receive all alerts, be it a simple error or a system error.
* **Error** - will receive alerts only when there is an error.

Content Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can control which section of the notification will be included in the email.

Workflow Groups
---------------
**Workflow Groups** are just a way to group your workflows. You can use this to filter your workflows or jobs
when working on multiple workflows.


Actions
-------
Once we created the workflow, the **Actions** tab will then be accessible.

An **Action** is a built-in process of Task Finder to simplify common task such as the following:

* Data Import
* Run Executable
* File Transfer
* SQL Command

Next topic will discuss all types of action the Task Finder currently supports.
